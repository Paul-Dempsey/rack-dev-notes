# Panels

My usual workflow for a new module is to prototype the panel design before I even start coding a module.
Sometimes I will also write a draft of the documentation before coding.
This helps me work out whether the design is explicable and makes sense.
Other devs do it the other way around: they don't worry much about the panel design until after they have a working module, and sometimes never get around to documentation, much to the dismay of some users.

I have a collection of stock SVG components (knobs, sliders, ports) that I can import or copy/paste that get removed for the actual running panel.
After I have this initial design up and running in a Rack module, there is a bit of transitional Inkscape process to eliminate transforms (ungroup everything that is grouped, then re-group movable units).
After that I hand-edit the SVGs as text.
I edit out all traces of inkscape.
All changes after that are in the VSCode text editor, with svg text / preview side-by-side.

Using a text editor is easier for me to ensure consistent colors, stroke widths, and positioning across modules.
I can copy/paste, then adjust coordinates and dimensions.

I have a mechanism to hot-reload the svgs in a module (including widgets).
This makes it quick and easy to make fine-grained adjustments.

## Inkscape tips

- Use px coordinates.
  Ignore the Rack guide that says to use mm SVG units. Rack itself doesn't consistently follow it's own guide here.

- Set up your SVG document like this: the most import items to set are circled (most of the others are per your preference).

  Now all your widget positioning code works in the same units that the Rack display system uses without `MMTOPX` everywhere. This allows for precise exact pixel positioning with a minimum of artifacts.

- Inkscape supports expressions in coordinate edit boxes. For example, if you want a 10U module: 1U = 15px, so type `10*15` in the Width edit box. (Module height is _always_ `380 px`).

- For colors, copy/paste the hex code, so your colors are exact and consistent.

- Prefer editing x,y,w,h in the toolbar over dragging with the mouse.

- The Align tab has gotten really good for aligning and distributing items. I consistently use "Last selected". The lets me mentally "Align this (or these three things) with _that_". Always using the same alignment option makes the workflow smooth because you don't have to re-think what going to happen.

- For re-usable SVG components, work in a scratch SVG in Inkscape.

  1. Create the design
  2. Move it to 0,0
  3. Ungroup/regroup to eliminate transforms.
  4. Add a `transform="translate(x, y)"` on the new group for positioning.

  Now I have a unit I can paste into panels.

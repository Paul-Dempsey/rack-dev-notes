# Use GenericBlank

Count me as a `helper.py` hater.
The problems with it have been discussed before on the forums, but I don't want to reiterate the details here.
Suffice to say that I disliked it enough that I created an alternative.

GenericBlank is a replacement for the Rack tutorial code that I think gets beginners to a much better place for further development.
It gives you a working module immediately (if you've set up your development environment correctly).

By working I mean:

1. Builds
2. Loads and displays in Rack

In the forums, we've seen many beginners get stuck almost immediately just getting the plugin to build and a module to load and display correctly in Rack.

See [Paul-Dempsey/GenericBlank: Template for a VCV Rack Blank module](https://github.com/Paul-Dempsey/GenericBlank#generic-blank).
